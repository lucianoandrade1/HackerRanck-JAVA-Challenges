//Hackerrank Java Strings Introduction challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:

//String myString = "Hello World!"

//The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

//Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

//1. Sum the lengths of A and B.
//2. Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
//3. Capitalize the first letter in  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

//Input Format

//The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string A. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

//Output Format

//There are three lines of output:

//For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.

//For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.

//For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
