//HackerRank Java Comparator challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

//The Player class is provided for you in your editor. It has 2 fields: a name String and a score integer.

//Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.

//Input Format

//Input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in the Solution class.

//The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of players.
//Each of the n subsequent lines contains a player's name and score, respectively.

//Constraints

//0 <= score <= 1000
//2 players can have the same name.
//Player names consist of lowercase English letters.

//Output Format

//You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. The locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object, use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.
