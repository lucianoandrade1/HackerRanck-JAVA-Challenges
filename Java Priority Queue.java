//Hackerrank Java Priority Queue challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. - Wikipedia

//In this problem we will test your knowledge on Java Priority Queue.

//There are a number of students in a school who wait to be served. Two types of events, ENTER and SERVED, can take place which are described below.

//ENTER: A student with some priority enters the queue to be served.
//SERVED: The student with the highest priority is served (removed) from the queue.
//A unique id is assigned to each student entering the queue. The queue serves the students based on the following criteria (priority criteria):

//The student having the highest Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is served first.
//Any students having the same CGPA will be served by name in ascending case-sensitive alphabetical order.
//Any students having the same CGPA and name will be served in ascending order of the id.
//Create the following two classes:

//The Student class should implement:
//The constructor Student(int id, String name, double cgpa).
//The method int getID() to return the id of the student.
//The method String getName() to return the name of the student.
//The method double getCGPA() to return the CGPA of the student.
//The Priorities class should implement the method List<Student> getStudents(List<String> events) to process all the given events and return all the students yet to be served in the //priority order.

//Input Format

//The first line contains an integer, n, describing the total number of events. Each of the  subsequent lines will be of the following two forms:

//ENTER name CGPA id: The student to be inserted into the priority queue.
//SERVED: The highest priority student in the queue was served.
//The locked stub code in the editor reads the input and tests the correctness of the Student and Priorities classes implementation.

//Constraints

//2 <= n <= 1000
//0 <= CGPA <= 4.00
//1 <= id <= 10^5
//2 <= |Name| <= 30

//Output Format

//The locked stub code prints the names of the students yet to be served in the priority order. If there are no such student, then the code prints EMPTY.
