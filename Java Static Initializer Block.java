//Hackerrank Java Static Initializer Block challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//Static initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded, and you can initialize static variables in those blocks.

//It's time to test your knowledge of Static initialization blocks. You can read about it here.

//You are given a class Solution with a main method. Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth B and height H. You should read the variables from the standard input.

//If B<=0 or H<=0 , the output should be "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

//Input Format

//There are two lines of input. The first line contains B: the breadth of the parallelogram. The next line contains H: the height of the parallelogram.

//Constraints

//-100 <=B<= 100
//-100 <=H<= 100

//Output Format

//If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram. Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.
