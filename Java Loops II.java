//HackerRank Java Loops II challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:

//(a + 2^0 * b),(a + 2^0 * b + 2^1 * b),...(a + 2^0 * b + 2^1 * b + ... + a + 2^(n-1) * b)

//You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

//Input Format

//The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
//Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, and ni values for that query.

//Constraints

//Output Format

//For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.
