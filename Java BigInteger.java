//Author: Luciano Andrade

//In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

//Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

//Input Format

//There will be two lines containing two numbers, a and b.

//Constraints

//a and b are non-negative integers and can have maximum 200 digits.

//Output Format

//Output two lines. The first line should contain a + b, and the second line should contain a x b. Don't print any leading zeros.
