//Hackerrank Java Output Formatting challenge
//Author: Luciano Andrade

//Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using printf.

//To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

//Input Format

//Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
//Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range 0 from 999 to .

//Output Format

//In each line of output there should be two columns:
//The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
//The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
